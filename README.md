## ✅ Troubleshooting
- ❌ **`st.secrets has no key oauth`**  
  → Ignore this error locally. It only applies to cloud deployment.
- ❌ **App hanging or slow**  
  → First run may take 15–30 seconds to fetch projections (Yahoo API).
- ❌ **No DST in player pool**  
  → Ensure you uploaded the correct salary file for NFL.
