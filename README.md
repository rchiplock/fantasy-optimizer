## ‚úÖ Features at a Glance
‚úî Supports DraftKings & FanDuel salary files 

‚úî Yahoo or FantasyPros (fallback) Projections 

‚úî Advanced Vegas logic for projected game flow (boost favorite RB / underdog pass catchers in blowouts, downgrade DST in shootouts) 
- **Spread Trigger (pts)**: When does game script start to matter? Set the point spread size (favorite vs underdog) where adjustments kick in. **Example**: At 7 pts, favored RBs gain an edge; underdog WR/TEs see more volume

- **Over/Under Trigger**: Games above this Over/Under threshold are considered shootouts and would boost WR/TE while slightly downgrading a DST. **Example**: At 47, WR/TE get a bump in high-scoring games; DST would get a small reduction

- **Vegas Impact Intensity (%)**: How much weight do Vegas odds add to player projections? 0% = ignore Vegas, 20% = strong game-script adjustments for spreads/totals

‚úî Lineup constraints:  
- Min uniqueness  
- Optional QB-WR stacking
