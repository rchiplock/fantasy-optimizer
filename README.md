### **Step 4: Set Up Yahoo Authentication**

2. To create this file:
   - Run the app (Step 6 below).
   - The app will show a Yahoo login link in your console.
   - **Click the link** → sign in → copy the code → paste it in the console.

### **Step 6: Run the App**
Run this command:
```
streamlit run fantasy_optimizer_pro_v2.py
```
If that **doesn't work** (you see "'streamlit is not recognized"), use:
```
python -m streamlit run fantasy_optimizer_pro_v2.py
```

✔ This will open the app in your browser at:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

### **Step 7: Use the App**
- Enter your Yahoo League ID (from your league URL, e.g., `1168764`).
- Enter your Odds API key.
- Upload your **salaries CSV** from DraftKings or FanDuel.
- Click **Run Optimizer** → Download your optimal lineups! 🎉

## ✅ Notes
- **Offseason?** Yahoo projections will show **0** (that’s normal).
- Your Yahoo tokens auto-refresh; no need to log in again unless they expire.
- All data stays **on your machine**; nothing is uploaded to a server.

## ✅ Troubleshooting
- ❌ **`st.secrets has no key oauth`**  
  → Ignore this error locally. It only applies to cloud deployment.
- ❌ **App hanging or slow**  
  → First run may take 15–30 seconds to fetch projections (Yahoo API).
- ❌ **No DST in player pool**  
  → Ensure you uploaded the correct salary file for NFL.
